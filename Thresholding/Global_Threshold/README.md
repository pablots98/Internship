# GLOBAL THRESHOLDING

Global thresholding is the simplest thresholding method. It works by analysing all the genes in each sample, based on their data it establishes a percentile (you can set the one you want), where the genes that are expressed above will be considered core-genes, and those that are not, considered non-core.

The folder includes different files.

- **Data**: Merged_data, Mod_data and NM2ENSG.

- **Metabolic models**: Human-GEM_Cobra_v1.01, SysBio_COBRA_v1.13 and SysBio_COBRA_v1.17_consensus.

- **Global_Threshold_reactions**: This code sets the core genes based on the above, and studies the percentage of core genes that are considered housekeeping genes. In turn, through these core-genes, the core-reactions needed to run the mCADRE algorithm are established.

The Global thresholding code was written following the considerations of Richelle et al., 2019.
